<h1>The Best Anime Movies According to Dhritiman</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Anime Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>I want to eat your pancreas.</h3>
<p>This is a very sad anime but you will enjoy almost the whole anime and its romantic/happy environment.</p>
<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>This anime is a very good work of friction. The ending is cliche but still very good.</p>
<h3>Josee, the tiger and the fish</h3>
<p>This is another very good romance anime with a good ending.</p>
